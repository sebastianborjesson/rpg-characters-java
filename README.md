* Equip a weapon
  * Side note: For demo purposes there is only one weapon to acquire
* Equip a armor

* See your character sheet with information on your character stats
  * This will display and list the characters name, class, current level, base attributes and its total DPS (Damage per second)
    
    * Side note: if the user has eqipped any armor and weapon the DPS stat line will be recalculated based on
    all attributes combined with the characters base stat line
